## To get the latest official development update
- Run `git pull origin main`

## IMPORTANT NOTE
- Remember to make commits and push to your own branch, not to main :)
- We will then run a test to make sure that the commits you have made can run without any errors.
- After the test:
    - If no errors --> create a pull request (PR) --> person in charge will merge to main branch
    - If error found --> fix in your respective branch --> re-push

大家加油！(ง •_•)ง
